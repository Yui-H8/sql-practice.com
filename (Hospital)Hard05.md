Q.05    
* Each admission costs $50 for patients without insurance, and $10 for patients with insurance. All patients with an even patient_id have insurance.  
  
Give each patient a 'Yes' if they have insurance, and a 'No' if they don't have insurance. Add up the admission_total cost for each has_insurance group.  

---
```SQL
select has_insurance,sum(admission_cost) as admission_total
from
(
   select patient_id,
   case when patient_id % 2 = 0 then 'Yes' else 'No' end as has_insurance,
   case when patient_id % 2 = 0 then 10 else 50 end as admission_cost
   from admissions
)
group by has_insurance
;
```
Answer2
```sql
SELECT
  has_insurance,
  CASE
    WHEN has_insurance = 'Yes' THEN COUNT(has_insurance) * 10
    ELSE count(has_insurance) * 50
  END AS cost_after_insurance
FROM (
    SELECT
      CASE
        WHEN patient_id % 2 = 0 THEN 'Yes'
        ELSE 'No'
      END AS has_insurance
    FROM admissions
  )
GROUP BY has_insurance
;
```
Answer3
```sql
select 'No' as has_insurance, count(*) * 50 as cost
from admissions where patient_id % 2 = 1 group by has_insurance
union
select 'Yes' as has_insurance, count(*) * 10 as cost
from admissions where patient_id % 2 = 0 group by has_insurance
;
```
